# simulation


A deep learning model created with Tensorflow and Keras + OpenCV to traverse the autonomous track used by Udacity Self-Driving Car Simulator\
https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim


To test this model, clone this repo and use a virtual env(like venv or conda environment)\
Install necessary modules (including TF 2.3.0 and Keras 2.4.3) and run the sim_connect.py (Basic Flask, Socketio WSGL)\
Run the simulator and choose autonomous mode.
